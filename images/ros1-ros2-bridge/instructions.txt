Run the command: 
"docker pull ros:galactic-ros1-bridge-focal"

Make a container based on that image, exec into it and run the following:
"
source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash &&
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash &&
ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge
"


or do a "docker compose up" in this directory
